    <h3>Story:</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, FIRST Robotics Team 1351 was forced to operate at home
        through
        online meetings for a majority of the 2021 season. As a result, we wanted to come up with some fun projects that
        the
        students could do at home. Myself and a few other team leaders put together an unofficial drone challenge in our
        team, where small groups of 3-4 students would design, build, and program their own drones. They were able to
        individually take parts and work on it from home, and each week we transferred supplies from house to house
        while making sure to be COVID-safe. Drones are very different
        than the usual robots that the team builds, so it was a fun challenge for the students while also being small
        enough to work on from home.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Myself and the other team leaders created criteria for the drone challenge, provided
        an
        education curriculum about drone design to the students, and mentored the small teams that participated in the
        challenge. I helped with planning the electronics and control systems of the
        drone. We ended up putting together 4 teams of students who were interested, and even got one drone to fly
        by the end of the 2021 season! We plan to continue the drones at the beginning of the 2022 season as a side
        project to hopefully get more off the ground. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The structure of the drones were 100% 3D printed, and consisted of a raspberry pi for
        the control board, four
        quadcopter motors, and various altitude, gyroscope, and accelerometer sensors. They were all designed,
        manufactured, and assembled from scratch by students on the team.</p>
