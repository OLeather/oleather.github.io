    <h4 style="text-align: center">Turret Lock System</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">During the 2021 season, I developed a turret lock system that allowed our robot's
        turret mechanism to lock onto a target on the field to shoot balls into, and could even score balls into the
        target while the robot was
        in motion. The system worked by combining computer vision 3D position calculations with onboard sensors
        measuring the drivetrain's velocity to create an accurate field-relative estimation of the robot's position. The
        sensors were combined using a Kalman Filter, which combines the noisy but absolute
        position from computer vision localization with the less noisy but drift-prone onboard encoder sensors to
        calculate the most likely position at any given time. Using a good estimation of the robot's state on the field
        (including absolute position and velocity), a control loop was developed to allow the turret to be aimed at a target location on the field  and
        even counteract the robot's motion to score balls while the robot is in
        motion.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center">Source Code</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The main turret control loop is found under <a
            href="https://github.com/MittyRobotics/tko2020/blob/c16df7195f4e10d1a7d97ec1ba8e98f49038f9f1/src/main/java/com/github/mittyrobotics/autonomous/Autonomous.java">Autonomous.java</a>
        file in the GitHub repository for our team's 2020-2021 robot. The Autonomous service deals with controlling the
        turret and shooter subsystems based on the turret lock control algorithm. It relies upon the <a
                href="https://github.com/MittyRobotics/tko2020/blob/c16df7195f4e10d1a7d97ec1ba8e98f49038f9f1/src/main/java/com/github/mittyrobotics/autonomous/util/RobotPositionTracker.java">RobotPositionTracker.java</a>
        service which is a kalman filter-based pose estimator. It also uses the <a
                href="https://github.com/MittyRobotics/tko2020/blob/c16df7195f4e10d1a7d97ec1ba8e98f49038f9f1/src/main/java/com/github/mittyrobotics/autonomous/Vision.java">Vision.java</a>
        service which localizes the robot according to perceived vision targets. The code relies upon my controls library, <a href="https://github.com/MittyRobotics/tko-libraries-legacy">tko-libraries-legacy</a> for mathematics helper functions, geometry classes, and robot kinematics calculations. </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center">Explanation of Code</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The first step of the turret lock system is to collect all the data required for the
        control loops. Most notably, the current pose and dynamics estimations are gathered from the
        RobotPositionTracker service, as well as info about the vision target's perceived location from the Vision
        service. Future robot pose is also roughly predicted given current robot dynamics, which is used for a velocity
        feedforward on the turret.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">The RobotPositionTracker service uses a simplified kalman filter that estimates 2D
        field pose based on drivetrain kinematics and computer vision 3D localization. Shown below are the input
        functions for kinematics state measurements and vision measurements.</p>
    <script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMittyRobotics%2Ftko2020%2Fblob%2Fc16df7195f4e10d1a7d97ec1ba8e98f49038f9f1%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fgithub%2Fmittyrobotics%2Fautonomous%2Futil%2FRobotPositionTracker.java%23L137-L157&style=dark&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on"></script>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The Vision service uses the 2D coordinates of the target from the vision camera and
        some physical parameters of the target (i.e., it's height from the ground and location on the field) to derive a
        3D pose estimation. That is used by the RobotPositionTracker's kalman filter as a global pose estimate. Safety
        checks are also done to ensure vision data is recent and reasonable compared to previous data and known
        constants of the field. If vision data is not currently safe to use, the pose estimator can continue to run
        using only drivetrain kinematics state estimates, and will be corrected as soon as vision data is safe
        again. </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">The control loops for both the shooter flywheel and the turret subsystems are below.
        The shooter uses a simplified control loop that is simply shifted up or down linearly according to the
        perpendicular component of the robot's velocity relative to the target. This was deemed acceptable given the
        normal operation of the system. The turret control loop is a multi-stage cascade control loop utilizing
        primarily PID loops. It controls the turret using a main position loop and a secondary velocity loop. It aims to
        first counteract the robot's angular velocity to maintain a constant heading in space, then adjusts the heading
        to point towards the target's 3D location in space, then compensates for ball trajectory in air by shifting left
        or right based on the robot's parallel velocity component to the target. Finally, future predicted motion is
        used as a velocity feedforward to improve tracking accuracy while the robot is in motion.</p>
