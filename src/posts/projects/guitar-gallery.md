# Custom Guitars
Ever since I got into woodworking, I have always wanted to build a guitar. I am an avid guitar player, so using my skills to make a guitar only seemed natural. The project was very enjoyable, and I am currently working on more guitar models!

I designed the guitars in Fusion 360, cut out the designs on my CNC router, and finish and assemble them by hand.

My first guitar design is my take on a modern Fender Stratocaster. It features a curved top body design, Floyd Rose Tremolo bridge, and three Seymour Duncan Hot Rails pickups each with individual coil splitting for a wide variety of sounds. The body is made of swamp ash with a curly maple top, and the neck is made out of all curly maple.

My second guitar design is based off the PRS Custom 24 model. I wanted to try to replicate the design with some of my own touches and a semi-hollow body for a warmer tone. It features a curly maple curved top and a mohogany back. I am still in the process of building this guitar.

Here is a gallery of some pictures I took of my finished guitars and the process to build them.
