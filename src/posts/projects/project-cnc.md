#### CNC Machine Demonstration

I had initially built a Lowrider 2 CNC by V1 Engineering to get into CNC routing. It was a great design that I used rigorously for about a year. However, I later decided that I wanted to design and build my own CNC router as a fun challenge that would also better fit my needs. After a three-month long process of iterative CADing, prototyping, and building, I created a machine that works really well.

#### CNC Cad Assembly in Fusion 360

The machine is controlled using the Marlin 2.0 firmware. I programmed a custom user interface for the control board that runs off of a raspberry pi and a 7 inch touch screen, which allows me to send commands to the machine and visualize it's sate.
