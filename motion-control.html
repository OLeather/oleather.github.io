    <h3>Story:</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">While I was a student on FIRST Robotics Team 1351, I implemented many motion control
        algorithms onto our robot. Motion control interested me because I found it fascinating to get faster, more
        precise, and more efficient movement out of a robotic mechanisms using code and mathematics.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Library</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Throughout my time on the team, I developed a large library that features many
        different motion control
        algorithms. <i class="fa fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/MittyRobotics/tko-libraries"
                                                    target="_blank">tko-libraries</a> Although motion control in
        robotics is very well documented and there are existing libraries that
        exist to
        implement many of these algorithms, I wanted to truly understand how they worked myself, so I researched and
        recreated many of
        them in my library. I also created some of my own algorithms in the library.</p>
    <h4>Motion Profiling</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Motion profiling was the first challenge I tackled. A "motion profile" is essentially
        a graph of a mechanism's
        state (position, velocity, acceleration, etc) over time. Motion profiles try to move the mechanism to a desired
        state while maintaining certain constraints about the mechanism, such as it's maximum velocity, acceleration,
        etc, which makes the motion smoother and safer for the mechanism. I implemented both a trapezoidal motion
        profile (which takes in 2 constraints: max velocity and
        acceleration) and an s-curve motion profile (which takes in 3 constraints: max velocity, acceleration, and
        jerk). The greater the number of constraints the profile takes in, the smoother the motion becomes but the more
        complicated the motion profile
        gets to calculate. Despite the challenges of increasing the number of constraints, I recently wanted to try
        achieving a long-term goal of mine: to create a motion profile
        that can be calculated given any number of constraints. Generally motion profiles are fixed to a certain number
        of constraints, but using a recursive calculus-based algorithm, I was able to create a motion profile that takes
        in any number of constraints and calculates a trajectory for a mechanism to reach it's desired state. From what
        I know, this is the first motion profile generator that can take in any number of constraints. <i

                target="_blank">N-th Degree Motion Profile Generator</a></p>
    <h4>Autonomous Navigation</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The next motion control algorithm I wanted to implement was an autonomous navigation
        system. In recent times, spline drivetrain following algorithms have been quite common in FRC, but I wanted to
        tackle a common issue with most of them that I've seen, which is their inefficiency when it comes to initial
        calculations. Generally, a trajectory must be calculated all at once in order to ensure the robot doesn't move
        too fast around corners or violate any of it's constraints (max velocity, acceleration, angular velocity, etc).
        I worked on developing an entirely realtime autonomous navigation system, which can generate paths and plan it's
        trajectory without any pre-calculations required. In fact, the trajectory itself can be changed at any point
        during the following without taking a performance hit. It works similar to a road paver: it paves the road ahead
        of it while driving on the road behind it. The trajectory is generated as the robot follows it, generating
        future points as it traverses prior points. The robot's constraints are maintained by sampling future
        points of the trajectory and ensuring that the robot's current state will not violate any of it's future
        required states. The result is an entirely realtime autonomous navigation system that allows the robot to follow
        spline paths while maintaining the drivetrain's linear and angular motion constraints. <i

    <h4>Turret Lock System</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">During the 2021 season, I developed a turret lock system that allowed our robot's
        turret mechanism to lock onto a target on the field to shoot balls into, and could even score balls into the
        target while the robot was
        in motion. The system worked by combining computer vision 3D position calculations with onboard sensors
        measuring the drivetrain's position to create an accurate field-relative estimation of the robot's position. The
        sensors were combined using a Kalman Filter, which is a statistical filter that prioritizes the short term of
        our less noisy but drift-prone onboard encoder sensors with the long term of our more noisy but absolute
        position from computer vision. Using a good estimation of the robot's state on the field (including absolute
        position and velocity), the turret could be aimed at a target location on the field and stay pointed at it, and
        could
        even my given compensation commands to counteract the robot's motion to still score balls while it is in
        motion. The result was a vert robust turret lock system that ensured the robot would score balls in the target
        no matter where it was or how it was moving.</p>
